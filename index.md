# Requests for Feedback
This repository aims at collecting feedback and comments from the community on 5G-MAG Publications.

To input feedback to a document please create a [new issue](https://github.com/5G-MAG/Requests-for-Feedback/issues/new/choose) with a corresponding template. Issues will be regularly reviewed by the relevant 5G-MAG workgroup.

@5G-MAG members: Note that this is a public repository, for IPR-sensitive information please use our internal Workgroups.

## Publications open for feedback/comments from the community

### **[5GMAG_REP_06]** "Media Services beyond 2D: Use Cases"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/media-services-beyond-2d-use-cases)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- existing commercial services in relation to the use cases in the report
- requirements on network and service aspects

### **[5GMAG_REP_05]** "Time synchronization services for media production over 5G networks"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/time-synchronization-services-for-media-production-over-5g-networks)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- existing implementation of NW-TT and DS-TT translators
- information on support of API in the operating system of a COTS device (e.g. Android/iOS, ...) for SIB9 and RRC messages exposure
- way forward on IEEE assignment for Organization ID for 3GPP in PTP frames

### **[5GMAG_REP_04]** "Time and Frequency Interleaving for broadcast services in 3GPP Systems"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/time-and-frequency-interleaving-for-broadcast-services-in-3gpp-systems)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- simulations for LTE-based 5G Broadcast with and without time-frequency interleaving with relevant channel models
- simulations for NR MBS Broadcast with and without time-frequency interleaving with relevant channel models
- simulations for NR MBS Broadcast over Non-Terrestrial Networks with and without time-frequency interleaving with relevant channel models.

### **[5GMAG_REP_03]** "Guidelines on registration and onboarding for media production equipment over 5G NPNs"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/guidelines-on-registration-and-onboarding-for-media-production-equipment-over-5gnpns)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- aspects related to registration, authentication and onboarding procedures for devices in NPNs (both SNPN and PNI-NPN)
- handling key issues identified for “device onboarding for SNPNs with UE without pre-provisioned credentials”:
  - Remote provisioning of credentials to UICCs of devices deployed in SNPNs may not be feasible using the GSMA Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and respective root keys due to the requirement for certification. Coexistence of GSMA PKI root keys and independent eSIM Certificate Authority (CA) root keys is not possible on a single GSMA compliant UICC.
  - There is no standardized provisioning scheme for non-UICC-based credentials (i.e., default UE credentials). This is a gap in the 5G ecosystem, out of 3GPP scope, and currently not addressed by other bodies or interest groups).

### **[5GMAG_REP_02]** "Spectrum access for live media production using Non-Public Networks (NPNs)"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/spectrum-access-for-live-media-production-using-non-public-networks)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- spectrum access models applicable to ad-hoc and nomadic deployments
- suitable frequency bands

### **[5GMAG_REP_01]** "Towards a comprehensive 5G-based toolbox for live media production"
**Download the publication [here](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/towards-a-comprehensive-5g-based-toolbox-for-live-media-production)**

General feedback is welcome. In particular we are looking for feedback on:
- features that 5G would ideally support for each scenario;
- solutions available in the 5G specifications currently under development
- requirements (values) and expectations
